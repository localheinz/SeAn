# Readme
This project was undertaken in the early 90s (ca. 1990), when I first got access to a computer and learned to code with Turbo Pascal. 
Sources of information at this point in time were *DOS International*, a magazine which oftentimes included some information about hidden, i.e. undocumented, registers that could be pulled.
Back then, I wanted to found an agency with my best friend, that's how we came up with SeAn, as in *Se*bastian and *An*dreas.

## SeanWorm
This is basically a port of `nibbles.bas`, which some of you may know from DOS (a basic interpreter was delivered with it) to Turbo Pascal, with a GUI and some other (icons, statistics, level editor).

## SeanMaus
Of course, I needed some mouse cursors, therefore, SeanMaus was written to create mouse cursors.

## SeanIcon
Also, icons were needed, therefore, SeanIcon was used to create icons.
